                    <li>The National School Lunch Program (NSLP), fed about 30 million children each school day in 2014 and cost $12.7 billion. The federal government spent another $3.7 billion in 2014 to feed about 14 million children through the School Breakfast Program (SBP).</li>
                    <li>Taxpayers spent $16 billion feeding kids breakfast and lunch last year.</li>
                    <li>The presidents budget for 2018: $13.1 billion for the National School Lunch Program (an increase of $659 million)
                    <li>$4.8 billion for the National School Breakfast Program (an increase of $287 million)</li>      
                    <li>America squanders just $1.2 billion via school lunch annually, a tiny slice of the estimated US$218 billion in food wasted in America each year</li>

                <h3 style="font-family:verdana;">How can we be more effective?</h3>
                <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Make students and schools more aware! They are two large members in the fight against food waste, but are highly ignored. If the awareness does not spread to the student then the fight could be possibly cut short or nothing worth while.</p>
            
            
            <h3 style="font-family:verdana;">There are many ways we can decrease waste: </h3> 
            <o1 style="font-family:verdana;">
            <li>Longer lunch periods should be created because not all students have an equal chance to eat lunch if they are buying. Also, having longer periods can lead to students consuming the correct amount of nutrition.</li>
            <li>Allowing students to have recess before lunch allows students to have an increase in appetite. There was a 50% change in fruit and vegetable consumption throughout students.</li>
            <li>Changing the lunchroom layout and having catchy names for fruits and vegetables will help more produce get eaten. Some name examples are 'Strong Bones Milk,' and 'Super Sweet Strawberries.'</li>
            <li>A share table can reduce waste in multiple ways because it will allow students to take what they want from the unwanted items from other students. </li>
            <li>Fruits and vegetables are encouraged to be taken by students however most students don't eat them and end up getting thrown into landfills all across the country, so we shouldn't force students to take things that they don't want.</li>
            <li>Collect unwanted and unopened food for cafeterias and distribute them to homeless shelters </li>
            <li>Use food waste for compost or fertilizer </li>
